# üìù Audit Findings and Remediation Report
*MedAccess Claims Portal ‚Äì Simulated Internal Audit (March 2025)*

---

## üìã Executive Summary

The internal audit identified several areas of strength and a few critical gaps that require remediation to ensure compliance, protect user data, and maintain system integrity.

Audited workflows: **User Login**, **Claims Submission**, **User Profile Updates**.

## ‚ùå Audit Findings

| # | Area | Finding | Severity | Risk Impact | Recommended Remediation |
|:--|:-----|:--------|:---------|:------------|:-------------------------|
| 1 | Login Security | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not consistently triggered after login. | Critical | Users are vulnerable to credential theft; increased risk of account takeover. | Enforce mandatory MFA for all logins immediately. Perform regression tests post-patch. |
| 2 | Claims Submission | Application crashes when users submit incomplete claims. | High | Data loss risk; user frustration; increased call center volume. | Implement client-side validation to enforce mandatory fields before submission. Deploy server-side validation as backup. |
| 3 | Profile Updates | Updates to user profile fields intermittently fail to save. | Medium | User data inconsistency; loss of trust; regulatory compliance issues (e.g., incorrect contact info). | Review API logic for user profile service; add transactional rollback and retry mechanisms. |
| 4 | Password Recovery | Password reset link expires prematurely (under 5 minutes). | Medium | User lockout risk; increased burden on support teams; negative UX. | Extend reset token validity to minimum industry standard (15 minutes). Update notification timing for clarity. |

## ‚úÖ Strengths Observed

- Password masking is correctly implemented on login fields.
- Session timeout triggers after 15 minutes of inactivity, as per security guidelines.
- Clear error messages are displayed for incorrect login attempts.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Impact Summary

- **Security Gaps:** MFA inconsistency significantly weakens system defense posture.
- **Operational Risk:** Claims submission crashes could result in delayed reimbursements and user dissatisfaction.
- **Compliance Risk:** Inaccurate user profile management risks violating data integrity policies.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è General Recommendations

- Conduct full regression testing after remediation of critical findings.
- Implement real-time monitoring on critical workflows (Login, Claims Submission).
- Schedule quarterly internal audits to maintain system integrity and early risk detection.

---

## üìà Conclusion

Immediate remediation of MFA and claims submission vulnerabilities is necessary to align with security best practices, user experience standards, and organizational risk tolerance.  
MedAccess Claims Portal exhibits a solid foundational structure but requires targeted improvements to achieve full audit readiness.
