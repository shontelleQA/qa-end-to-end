# 📝 Final Defect Trend Summary
*MedAccess Claims Portal – Simulated Project*

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project simulates real-world Process Quality Assurance (QA) work by monitoring, tracking, and analyzing defect trends across the MedAccess Claims Portal over a 4-week period (March 3–28, 2025).  
The goal was to identify patterns, assess risk impacts, and recommend improvements based on systematic defect tracking.

---

## 📊 Key Observations

- **Total defects logged:** 12
- **Major modules impacted:** Login, Claims Module, User Profile
- **Severity distribution:**
  - 2 Critical
  - 4 High
  - 4 Medium
  - 2 Low
- **High-risk areas identified:**
  - Login authentication and session management
  - Claims submission reliability
  - User profile data integrity

---

## ⚠️ Risk Impact Analysis

- **Login module issues** (failures, session timeouts, MFA errors) represented serious usability and security risks.
- **Claims Module crashes and delays** posed significant operational risks to core functionality and member satisfaction.
- **User Profile defects** risked degrading trust and increasing customer support volume.

These areas would require immediate remediation to prevent escalations or negative member experiences.

---

## 📈 Trend Highlights

- Defect rates spiked following simulated system updates during Week 1 and Week 4.
- Login-related defects were consistently high across all weeks.
- Claims-related issues reappeared, indicating potential gaps in regression coverage.

---

## 🛠️ Recommendations

- **Implement Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Increase surveillance after production releases to catch login/claims issues early.
- **Prioritize Hotfixes for Critical Paths:** Deploy immediate patches for MFA failures and claims crashes.
- **Enhance Regression Testing:** Strengthen regression testing particularly around claims workflows and profile management.
- **Conduct Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate why login failures persisted across multiple weeks despite patch attempts.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This exercise highlights the importance of proactive defect monitoring, structured reporting, and continuous feedback loops for maintaining system quality.  
The approach mirrors key responsibilities of Process QA Specialists at healthcare and insurance organizations such as Centene Corporation.
