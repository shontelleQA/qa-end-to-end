# üêû Bug Taxonomy Cheat Sheet

Clear categorization of defects helps prioritize fixes, communicate risks, and maintain product quality ‚Äî especially in critical sectors like healthcare, insurance, and government technology.

This cheat sheet outlines common types of software bugs, examples based on real-world applications, and how I prioritize and communicate defects during testing.

## üêõ Common Bug Types

| Bug Type | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Functional Defect | The system doesn't work according to requirements or user expectations. | Claim submission button doesn't trigger backend validation. |
| Usability Issue | The system works but is confusing, inefficient, or frustrating to use. | Appointment scheduling flow buries key options several clicks deep. |
| Data Integrity Bug | Information is lost, corrupted, or inaccurately displayed/stored. | Patient record fields overwrite prior entries without warning. |
| Security Vulnerability | The system improperly exposes data or allows unauthorized access. | Claim history visible without login under certain conditions. |
| Compatibility Issue | Application behaves differently across devices, browsers, or OS versions. | Payment portal fails to load on mobile Safari. |
| Performance Defect | System responds too slowly, crashes under load, or hangs. | Healthcare portal takes 20+ seconds to load after login. |
| Accessibility Barrier | Application isn't usable by people with disabilities (vision, mobility, etc.). | No screen reader labels for vital form fields in insurance application. |

## ‚ö° Severity vs Priority

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Severity | Impact of the bug on system functionality or users. | "Critical" ‚Äî app crashes when submitting a claim. |
| Priority | How urgently the bug should be fixed relative to business needs. | "High" ‚Äî minor UI bug on login page of a live MedTech system. |

I evaluate and log bugs with both **severity** and **priority** to help stakeholders make informed release decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Defect Logging Best Practices

When documenting bugs, I ensure:
- **Clear Title** ‚Äî Short, specific (e.g., "Submit Button Unresponsive on Claims Page").
- **Detailed Steps to Reproduce** ‚Äî Including environment, credentials if needed, and any relevant data inputs.
- **Observed vs Expected Behavior** ‚Äî Clear contrast.
- **Attachments** ‚Äî Screenshots, screen recordings, or logs when available.
- **Impact Statement** ‚Äî Quick explanation of who/what is affected ("High-risk for claims processing delays").
