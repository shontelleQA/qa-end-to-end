# üìë Pagination Test Cases ‚Äì GoRest API

This document outlines test cases that verify pagination behavior of the GoRest API.  
These scenarios confirm that records are properly divided across pages without duplication.

---

## üìã Preconditions
- Base URL is configured in Postman environment as `{{baseUrl}}`.
- A valid Bearer Token (`{{token}}`) is set in the environment.
- The `/users` endpoint contains multiple user records to allow meaningful pagination.

## ‚úÖ Positive Test Cases

### 1. Retrieve Page 1 of Users

| Field         | Value                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Method**    | GET                                           |
| **Endpoint**  | `{{baseUrl}}/users?page=1`                   |
| **Preconditions** | Valid token |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Send GET request for page 1.<br>2. Observe response. |
| **Expected Result** | 200 OK. Response contains a non-empty array of user objects. Each user object includes `id`, `name`, `email`, `gender`, and `status`. |

### 2. Retrieve Page 2 of Users

| Field         | Value                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Method**    | GET                                           |
| **Endpoint**  | `{{baseUrl}}/users?page=2`                   |
| **Preconditions** | Valid token |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Send GET request for page 2.<br>2. Observe response. |
| **Expected Result** | 200 OK. Response contains a non-empty array of user objects. Data is distinct from page 1. |

## ‚ùå Negative/Validation Test Cases

### 3. Verify No Overlap Between Page 1 and Page 2

| Field         | Value                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Method**    | GET                                           |
| **Endpoint**  | `{{baseUrl}}/users?page=1` and `{{baseUrl}}/users?page=2` |
| **Preconditions** | Valid token; multiple user records exist |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Retrieve user IDs from page 1.<br>2. Retrieve user IDs from page 2.<br>3. Compare both sets of IDs. |
| **Expected Result** | No overlapping IDs between page 1 and page 2. Both responses should contain distinct records. |

---

## ‚úÖ Notes
- These tests validate that pagination works as expected and prevents data duplication across pages.
- If overlapping IDs are observed, it indicates a defect in pagination logic.
- Evidence should include screenshots of both responses and comparison of ID sets.
