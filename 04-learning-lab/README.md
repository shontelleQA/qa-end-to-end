# ðŸ”¬ 04-Learning-Lab Overview

This section of my portfolio highlights self-directed QA artifacts â€” focusing on critical thinking, risk analysis, and testing strategy.

Each document is designed to demonstrate key skills beyond scripted test execution:
- Deep exploratory analysis to uncover real-world risks.
- Defect classification and prioritization based on impact and urgency.
- Strategic decision-making between manual and automated approaches.

I created this Learning Lab to simulate the type of judgment calls, risk-based prioritization, and quality advocacy required in MedTech, InsurTech, and GovTech QA environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters

In industries where system reliability directly impacts health outcomes, financial stability, or citizen services, strong critical thinking is as essential as execution.  
This section showcases my ability to think, adapt, and advocate for quality at every stage of the software development lifecycle.
