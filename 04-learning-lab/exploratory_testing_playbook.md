# 🧪 Exploratory Testing Playbook

This document outlines my approach to exploratory testing, a critical skill for identifying issues beyond scripted test cases. I use exploratory testing to simulate real user behavior, uncover hidden defects, and validate application workflows — especially in high-impact industries like healthcare, insurance, and government systems.

## 🎯 What is Exploratory Testing?

Exploratory testing is a simultaneous process of learning, test design, and test execution.  
Rather than following pre-written test cases, I interact with the application dynamically, adapting my tests based on real-time findings.

Key goals:
- Discover unexpected issues users might encounter.
- Validate that the system behaves logically and consistently.
- Identify risks and edge cases early.

## 🏥 Why Exploratory Testing Matters in MedTech, InsurTech, and GovTech

Industries like healthcare, insurance, and government require **high assurance** that systems are:
- Reliable (errors could impact health, financial claims, or citizen services)
- Secure (protect sensitive personal information)
- Accessible (usable by diverse populations)

Exploratory testing supplements scripted testing by:
- Catching real-world user behavior flaws.
- Surfacing missing requirements or misunderstood features.
- Finding gaps that automation might miss.

## 🧩 Example Exploratory Charters

Here are sample exploratory charters I might create during a testing session:

| Charter | Purpose | Example Actions |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🧑‍💻 Test new user registration | Verify account creation works smoothly and fails gracefully on invalid input. | - Register with valid and invalid email addresses.<br>- Attempt to register twice with the same information.<br>- Leave required fields blank and submit. |
| 🏥 Explore medical appointment scheduling flow | Validate appointment creation for different specialties and times. | - Schedule an appointment with valid inputs.<br>- Attempt to schedule outside of clinic hours.<br>- Cancel and reschedule an appointment. |
| 🛡️ Explore insurance claim submission portal | Ensure claim submissions handle edge cases correctly. | - Submit claim with missing supporting documents.<br>- Submit same claim twice.<br>- Navigate away mid-submission and return. |

## 🛠️ My Exploratory Testing Approach

When conducting exploratory testing, I follow these practices:
- **Timebox** sessions (e.g., 60-minute deep dives per feature).
- **Prioritize risk** — I target the most critical or user-facing areas first.
- **Document observations** immediately (screenshots, notes, logs).
- **Report findings** with clear reproduction steps whenever possible.
- **Suggest improvements** if usability or workflow gaps are discovered.

I view exploratory testing as a creative, analytical exercise that complements structured test execution.
