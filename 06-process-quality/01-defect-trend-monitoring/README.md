# 📈 Defect Trend Monitoring and Reporting Project
*MedAccess Claims Portal – Simulated Project*

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Process Quality Assurance (QA) assignment focused on monitoring, analyzing, and reporting defect trends for the **MedAccess Claims Portal** (fictional system) over a 4-week period in **March 2025**.

The goal was to demonstrate the ability to:

- Track and log defects systematically
- Identify risk patterns based on defect data
- Summarize findings in a structured, actionable format
- Recommend remediations to leadership for process improvement

This project mirrors core QA Specialist responsibilities, including monitoring performance, supporting audit readiness, and identifying continuous improvement opportunities — key expectations for roles such as QA Analyst or Quality Assurance Analyst.
