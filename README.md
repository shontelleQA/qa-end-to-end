# 🧪 QA Portfolio – Nicole Nealy

This repository showcases my work as a **Software QA Analyst**, focusing on real testing projects, functional workflows, API validation, and early-stage automation using live, testable applications. Each folder documents hands-on work aligned with Agile QA roles — including test planning, case design, execution logs, and defect tracking.

## ▶️ Process QA Projects

This section highlights structured Process QA work, including defect monitoring, SOP documentation, and internal audit simulations aligned to healthcare and insurance industry standards.

- [📈 Defect Trend Monitoring and Reporting – MedAccess Claims Portal (March 2025)](04_process_quality/01-defect-trend-monitoring/)
- [🔒 SOP Documentation and QA Readiness Guide – User Login Process (March 2025)](04_process_quality/02-sop-qa-readiness/)
- [🛡️ Internal Audit Simulation – MedAccess Claims Portal (March 2025)](04_process_quality/03-internal-audit-simulation/)

## 🧮 SQL QA Projects

This section focuses on backend data validation using SQL — testing what happens *after* a user submits a form, and ensuring that frontend behaviors are accurately stored in the database. These tests mimic real-world QA scenarios tied to payments, records, and service requests.

- [📬 Form Submission Tracker – SQL Data Validation (May 2025)](03_data_validation_sql/01_form_submission_sql_project/)

## 🎯 Role Alignment

This portfolio reflects work done in the scope of a QA Analyst or Manual QA role:

- ✅ Manual test case design and execution
- ✅ Test planning, exploratory testing, and defect tracking
- ✅ API validation using Postman
- ✅ Root cause investigation and regression testing
- ✅ SQL data checks and backend flow validation
- ✅ Agile-aligned documentation and sprint-style delivery
- ✅ Process quality monitoring, internal auditing, and SOP validation

Each project includes real artifacts — test plans, screenshots, traceability matrices, execution logs, and defect summaries — to simulate how I contribute in a real team setting.

## 📫 Let’s Connect

I'm currently exploring:

- Manual QA or hybrid testing roles  
- Healthcare, edtech, or purpose-driven QA projects  
- Contract or full-time QA opportunities  
- Coffee chats with other testers and tech folks

📍 Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-nealy/) if you're hiring, mentoring, or just want to talk shop about testing workflows, edge cases, or automation rabbit holes.
