# 🧪 QA Systems Validation Suite – Nicole Nealy

Welcome!  
This repository showcases how I approach **end-to-end software quality assurance** — from user-facing workflows to API and database validation. It’s the bridge between manual testing, automation, and process QA, built to reflect how real teams trace data across multiple layers of a system.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To demonstrate how I validate data integrity and user workflows across UI, API, and backend systems — using realistic test artifacts, automation, and documentation that mirrors Agile QA practices.

This repo represents the **integration layer** of my portfolio, connecting:
- UI testing (what users see)
- API validation (how data moves)
- SQL verification (where data lives)
- Process QA (how teams maintain quality)

## 🧱 What’s Inside

| Area | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 🧪 **UI Workflow Testing** | Test plans, execution logs, and screenshots from manual QA cycles on public test apps. |
| 🔗 **API Validation** | Postman CRUD collections and Python tests that confirm data accuracy and schema compliance. |
| 🧮 **Data Validation (SQL)** | SQL-based backend checks ensuring submitted form data is stored, transformed, and retrieved correctly. |
| 🧾 **Process Quality & Audits** | SOP readiness guides, defect trend analysis, and internal audit simulations. |
| 📚 **Learning Lab** | QA strategy notes, exploratory testing exercises, and mini playbooks from my ongoing study. |

---

## 📊 Sample Evidence

- ✅ Functional tests executed in **Qase**, linked to a traceability matrix  
- 🔗 **Postman** chained request flows with positive and negative assertions  
- 🧮 **SQL queries** validating record counts and transformation logic  
- 📈 **Defect trend charts** and root-cause notes from process QA cycles  

Screenshots and documentation for each are stored inside their respective subfolders.

## 🧠 Outcome

This suite demonstrates how I approach **system-level QA validation** — following the data journey from  
`User Actions (UI)` → `API Requests` → `Database Storage` → `Reports & Audits`.

It reflects how I think as a tester: curious about the *why*, focused on the *how*, and committed to building transparent QA processes that teams can trust.

This repository is part of a larger portfolio that forms a full QA architecture:

- [**QA Automation (Selenium E-Commerce)**](https://github.com/shontelleQA/qa-automation-python-selenium-ecommerce) – Frontend + API automation framework  
- [**Healthcare Data QA (ETL Validation)**](https://github.com/shontelleQA/healthcare-data-qa) – Backend + data pipeline validation  
Together, these projects show how I verify **data integrity across the full stack** — from user click to database record.
