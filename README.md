# 🧪 QA Portfolio – Nicole Nealy

This repository showcases my work as a **Software QA Analyst**, focusing on real testing projects, functional workflows, API validation, and early-stage automation using live, testable applications. Each folder documents hands-on work aligned with Agile QA roles — including test planning, case design, execution logs, and defect tracking.

## 🎯 Role Alignment

This portfolio reflects work done in the scope of a QA Analyst or Manual QA role:

- ✅ Manual test case design and execution
- ✅ Test planning, exploratory testing, and defect tracking
- ✅ API validation using Postman
- ✅ Root cause investigation and regression testing
- ✅ SQL data checks and backend flow validation
- ✅ Agile-aligned documentation and sprint-style delivery

Each project includes real artifacts — test plans, screenshots, traceability matrices, execution logs, and defect summaries — to simulate how I contribute in a real team setting.

## 📫 Let’s Connect

I'm currently exploring:

- Manual QA or hybrid testing roles  
- Healthcare, edtech, or purpose-driven QA projects  
- Contract or full-time QA opportunities  
- Coffee chats with other testers and tech folks
