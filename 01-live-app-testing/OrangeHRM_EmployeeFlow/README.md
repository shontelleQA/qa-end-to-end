# 🟠 OrangeHRM Employee Management Testing Project

This project documents hands-on QA testing of the **Employee Management** workflow inside the [OrangeHRM Open Source Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/).

It simulates a real sprint cycle — covering test planning, manual test case design, execution tracking, and defect reporting — using live application flows, real test data, and practical QA artifacts.

## 🎯 Scope of Testing

- User login and logout flows
- Adding a new employee (basic required fields + optional photo upload)
- Searching for an employee in the directory
- Editing employee details
- Form validation (error handling on required fields)
- Field reset/cancel functionality
- Basic UI feedback (form resets, confirmation messages)

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Qase Test Management | Test case organization and execution tracking |
| Google Sheets (Excel export) | Test case management and RTM backup |
| VS Code + GitHub | Portfolio and artifact version control |
| Markdown | Documentation and reporting |
| Windows Snipping Tool | Screenshots for test evidence |

> 📌 **Note:** While Jira is a common industry standard for defect tracking and test management, this project uses [Qase.io](https://qase.io/) to simulate real-world workflows. Qase provides similar functionality for organizing test cases, managing execution cycles, and tracking defects — aligning closely with Agile QA practices.

## 🎯 Role Alignment

This project demonstrates core QA analyst responsibilities:

- ✅ Manual test case design and structured execution
- ✅ Defect identification, logging, and retesting workflows
- ✅ Requirements mapping and traceability practices
- ✅ Exploratory mindset for edge cases and validation scenarios
- ✅ Agile sprint simulation with deliverable artifacts
