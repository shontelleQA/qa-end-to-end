# GoRest API Automation â€“ Phase 1

This folder contains my starter automation scripts for the GoRest API.

## Why I Built This
I'm expanding my manual API testing project into basic automation using Python.  
The goal was to keep it clean, beginner-to-mid-level friendly, and reflective of the kind of real-world API validations I'd handle in a QA role â€” without overcomplicating things with heavy frameworks right away.

## Tools I Used
- Python 3.x
- Requests library
- (Optional later) Pytest for organizing and scaling the tests
- VS Code for scripting
- GitHub for version control and sharing my work

## What's Inside
| Script | What it Tests |
|:-------|:--------------|
| `test_create_user.py` | Positive test: Create user with valid data (201 Created). |
| `test_negative_create_user.py` | Negative test: Try creating a user with missing email (422 Validation Error). |
| `test_auth_invalid_token.py` | Authorization test: Send request with invalid token (401 Unauthorized). |

Each script is standalone and focuses on building core automation skills first: making the API call, validating the response, and handling assertions cleanly.

## How I Approached It
- I focused on making sure every test is readable, simple, and realistic for junior-to-mid QA roles.
- I used the Requests library to keep it lightweight and easy to understand.
- Future plans include expanding this into a Pytest-driven test suite for even cleaner organization and batch running.

ðŸ§¡ Thanks for taking a look at my work!  
I'm excited to keep growing and layering in more advanced automation as I go.
